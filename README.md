# Improper File Handling in PHP

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: improper file handling.  The code attempts to open a non-existent file without adequately checking for errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior and application crashes.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.php` file offers a more robust solution using more advanced PHP features for error management.

This example highlights the importance of rigorous error handling when interacting with the file system in PHP.  Always verify that file operations are successful before proceeding, and include proper error handling to gracefully manage failures.
